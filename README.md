#### The role of this repository within the Citizendesk architecture

*Interface* stands for Application Programming Interface, that is API. The role of the code here is to expose the resources produced by the server-side, core Citizendesk components. Once exposed to an API, they can be used by a web or mobile frontend, see for example the web [Citizendesk frontend](https://github.com/sourcefabric-innovation/citizendesk-frontend)
