### Initialisation scripts

This folder contains scripts useful to initialise the database. It
will be possible to run the scripts all together or just one
collection at a time.

- `main.py` contains the definitions used around
- `init_all.py` can be used to run all the collection initialisations

The other scripts will initialise one collection at a time.

Run with `python initialise/init_all.py` or `python initialise/users.py`
